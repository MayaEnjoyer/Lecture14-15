                Mai is an attractive individual—described as an inside-out beauty by Kaede—with waist-length black hair that has bangs hanging on the left side with a bunny-shaped barrette in the back, blue-purplish eyes and a slim and fit figure.

            <p>Mai is an attractive individual—described as an inside-out beauty by Kaede—with waist-length black hair that has bangs hanging on the left side with a bunny-shaped barrette in the back, blue-purplish eyes and a slim and fit figure. She's fairly tall for a Japanese girl, standing at a height of 165 cm.</p>
            <p>In her bunny costume, she wears bright black high heels and wraps her long, slender legs in translucent black tights. Similar to a black leotard, the outfit highlighted the lines of her body, while the chest made a firm, modest valley. White cuffs accented her wrists and her neck was adorned by a white smart collar with a black bowtie. On the waist of the leotard, a white bunny tail is on her waist. Mai wears the bunny costume only twice throughout the series; she maintains the rabbit-themed motif by continuing to wear the aforementioned bunny-shaped barrette, while her phone is covered by a personalized phone case shaped like bunny ears.</p>
            <p>She is often seen in her school uniform, which consists of a white collared shirt, a red tie, a cream vest, brown shoes, and a blue skirt with a light brown blazer on top that she wears unbuttoned. She wears translucent black tights with her uniform as well. When not being at school, she usually wears her casual attire, which consists of a light blue button-up sleeveless shirt with a white jacket that is open up, dark blue long pants, and a pair of light black colored high heeled sandals.</p>
            <p>In the trailer for the second movie, Rascal Does Not Dream of a Sister Venturing Out, Mai is shown to wear glasses. In the second anime series, Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus, Mai no longer wears the bunny-shaped barrette, and also has a new phone without the bunny-ears case. Despite this, her association with the animal lives on in the form of a bunny necklace.</p>

                Mai is a very kind yet serious individual, which is especially evident around Sakuta. She isn't cold, but given the bitterness she harbored at first, she comes across as somewhat aloof in her demeanor in the first episodes, with a tendency to want to be on her own; despite wearing a bunny costume at the library for attention, she wasn't willing to attract more attention than necessary for herself. When noticed and recognized, she would be listening to music using earphones. Largely justified by her fame-laden childhood, which stopped her from being in school long enough to make friends, her somewhat bitter attitude changes, also thanks to meeting Sakuta. Upon resuming her acting career, Mai gradually starts opening up to people, and at that moment, it turns out she has all the kindness, maturity, and professionalism expected from an actress of her status - indeed, also in public appearances, she's shown to be composed and polite yet very approachable and friendly. She is also a high achiever at school, helping Sakuta at studying, and good at cooking.            </p>
            <p>Despite her reserved nature, she is a warm-hearted person and doesn't deny her feelings; indeed, she has no problem telling Sakuta how much she loves him, even despite the teasing and seemingly nonchalant responses she gives him at times. Instead, when it comes to topics she's uncomfortable with, Mai tends to ignore and stuff unpleasant feelings down rather than deal with them, as seen when, before her invisibility was subdued by Sakuta, she harbored deep anxiety over the possibility that she could be forgotten entirely and over the topic of her hiatus, as she still harbored bitter feelings over the circumstances that caused them; these feelings have now subsided since she started acting at another agency. While, just like Sakuta, she has a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, she really is innocent at heart and can become shy and flustered when Sakuta teases her. She is a genuine and kind-hearted person who would never harm anyone.</p>
            <p>Mai is actually very polite, levelheaded, helpful, and altruistic. Examples of her kind and warm nature include when Mai denounced the hospitalization incident as false for Sakuta's sake and when she gave Kaede, Sakuta's younger sister, a dress both as a gift and to at least spark interest in returning to the outside world, showing that, underneath her reserved and composed exterior, she is very sweet and loving. Kaede herself is very fond of Mai, seeing her as a role model for her beauty and kindness, and wishes she could be just like her. Mai indeed is reliable, empathetic and emotionally mature, and is consistently shown helping others.</p>
            <p>Though at first Mai could be somewhat harsh and strict towards Sakuta at times due to his lewd remarks and call him a pervert or an idiot, she is genuinely affectionate and kind to him as well, and she often says that she loves him more than he thinks - which is proven to be true. Then, as her relationship with Sakuta goes on, she becomes less strict and more cheerful and openly affectionate.</p>
            <p>In the end, Mai is definitely a kind, sweet and nice girl at heart, and, just like Sakuta, she has a quick wit yet is immensely good-hearted. She's unwaveringly loyal and virtuous, and shows the full extent of her kindness and selflessness as she sacrifices herself to save Sakuta from being hit by a car and become Shoko's heart donor. However, she's revived as Sakuta manages to get back in time to save her.</p>
            <p>Despite her kindness, though, and although she has forgiven her, she's still shown to resent her mother, given that she pretty much used her as a tool for easy money.</p>
